## Overview

We propose a **differentiable, analytic grasp metric** that enables collision-free grasp synthesis for dexterous hands in seconds **(vs. minutes for existing methods).** 
Our grasp metric is a relaxation of the feasibility LP traditionally used to check if a grasp is in "force closure:"


$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell^*(q) = \max_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^m, \; \ell \in \mathbb{R}} & \quad \ell \\
\text{s.t.} & \quad W(q) \alpha  = 0\\
& \quad \mathbf{1}^T \alpha = 1 \\
& \quad \alpha \geq \ell \mathbf{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

We show [empirically](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13687.pdf#page=7){:class="link-custom"} that optimizing our metric yields robust grasps and it is [well-correlated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13687.pdf#page=4){:class="link-custom"}  with existing metrics.

Using results from differentiable optimization, we can compute gradients of our metric $$\ell^*(q)$$ with respect to the hand configuration $$q$$ in **fractions of a millisecond**.
This allows us to quickly generate **diverse, collision-free grasps** using nonlinear programming. 

Our method for grasp generation, FRoGGeR, can be used to quickly post-process grasps generated from both simple heuristics and learning-based generative models, and has exciting applications for both real-time grasp planning and 
for generating grasp data at scale for training learning-based models.

## Results


#### Grasp Optimzation
We study FRoGGeRâ€™s performance on over 40 objects drawn from the YCB dataset,
outperforming [a competitive baseline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00195.pdf){:class="link-custom"}  in computation time, feasibility rate of 
grasp synthesis, and picking success in simulation. We conclude that FRoGGeR is fast: 
it has a median synthesis time of **0.834s** over hundreds of experiments.

#### Comparison with Ferrari-Canny

We also study how our proposed metric $$\ell^*(q)$$ correlates with existing metrics for grasp quality. We find that our metric is well-correlated with the traditional $$\epsilon$$-ball (or "Ferrari-Canny") grasp metric,
a a standard robustness measure for dexterous grasping.
